# Shitty Windows Commands

These are custom shitty commands for windows users :
	- **home.cmd**: shortcut for navigate to %homepath%
	- **mkfile.cmd**: create files in current directory. 
	- **withnp.cmd**: open notepad++ with or without a file

You can add each command in your Path to use them more easily.
Feel free to suggest improvements, rectifications or new commands.

## Home
When you are in any folder and you want to go back to your user folder just type `home` .
##### Exemple
```
C:\Users\user\path\to\current\folder>home

## Mkfile
